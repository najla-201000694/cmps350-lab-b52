<p>
    <b>A bid by the Australian government to delay Novak Djokovic's appeal against deportation has been rejected by a
        judge overseeing his case.</b>
    The government had requested the tennis star's court hearing be postponed until Wednesday, but it will instead begin
    as scheduled on Monday morning.
    <q>Djokovic was denied entry to Australia after landing in Melbourne </q>last week to defend his Australian Open title.
    His case has caused a huge outcry and made headlines around the world.
    The world number one men's tennis player - who has said he is opposed to vaccination - is in an immigration
    detention centre as his lawyers prepare to appeal against a decision by Australia's federal government to cancel his
    visa.
    Djokovic, 34, had been granted a medical exemption to play in the Australian Open tournament in a decision that
    infuriated many ordinary Australians who have been living under some of the world's strictest Covid rules.
